				I'm a backend developer at Code d'Or, living in Sunta≈æi Parish (Latvia). After I graduated in 2012 I started at Code d'Or. We write code in PHP, till 2 years ago that was mainly CakePHP 2, but now the most projects we do are written with Laravel.

			<p class="mb-4">
				My main focus is PHP, but I like to write some code in javascript (mainly Vue.js, this site is built with Astro) and sometimes I even experiment with CSS (this website is written with Tailwind) and some DevOps stuff.
