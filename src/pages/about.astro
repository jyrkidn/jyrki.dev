				I'm a backend developer at Code d'Or, living in Sunta≈æi Parish (Latvia). After I graduated in 2012 I started at Code d'Or. We write code in PHP, till 2 years ago that was mainly CakePHP 2, but now the most projects we do are written with Laravel.

				You can find out more here here about the tools we use. If you want to know my personal setup, check back later, that will be my first blog post.

			<p class="mb-4">
				My main focus is PHP, but I like to write some code in javascript (mainly Vue.js, this site is built with Astro) and sometimes I even experiment with CSS (this website is written with Tailwind) and some DevOps stuff.
