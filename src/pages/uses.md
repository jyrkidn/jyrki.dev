## Dev tools

- As IDE I use [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) with the following plugins:
  - [Github Copilot](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
  - [Astro](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20959-astro)
- PHPStorm setup is still a WIP, but started with following this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVTk-F3g9XM)
- For older projects that I have to access via SSH I tend to switch back to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- As Terminal I use [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).
- For both I use the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme combined with the [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font.
- On my Mac I use [Arc](https://arc.net/) as browser with the [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) extension.
- To track my time I use [Toggl](track.toggl.com/)
- To manage databases I use [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)

## MacOS

- Since switching to Mac (using a M1 laptop) I'm a big fan of [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
  - [Search Authy](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/blob/efc52d7a204b8832f35f17d10c500c2e3881a66c/extensions/authy/README.md)
